# Contrib

The contrib directory contains code which is not part of the main Forecasting repository, but deemed to be of interest and aligned with the goals of this repository. The code does not need to follow our strict coding guidelines, and is typically not tested via our DevOps pipeline.

Each project should live in its own subdirectory `/contrib/<project>` and contain a README.md file with detailed description what the project does and how to use it. In addition, when adding a new project, a brief description should be added to the table below.


## Projects

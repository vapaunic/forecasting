# Forecasting examples

This folder contains Python and R examples for building forecasting solutions presented in Python Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown files, respectively. The examples are organized according to forecasting scenarios in different use cases with each subdirectory under `examples/` named after the specific use case. 

At the moment, the repository contains a single retail sales forecasting scenario utilizing [Dominick's OrangeJuice dataset](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/datasets/dominicks). The name of the directory is `grocery_sales`.
